# Blockchain-Based Community Energy Storage

A decentralized platform for managing community-owned energy storage systems, optimizing renewable energy usage, and reducing grid dependency.

## Overview

This project leverages blockchain technology to create a transparent, efficient, and equitable system for communities to share energy storage resources. By decentralizing the management of battery systems, capacity allocation, usage optimization, and maintenance funding, the platform enables communities to maximize the value of renewable energy generation while building resilience and reducing costs.

## Core Smart Contracts

### Battery Registration Contract

Securely registers and tracks community energy storage assets:

- Battery system specifications (capacity, charge/discharge rates, efficiency)
- Installation details and location data
- Ownership structure (individual, shared, or community-owned)
- Warranty information and expected lifecycle
- Historical performance metrics
- Certification and compliance documentation

### Capacity Sharing Contract

Manages the fair allocation of storage capacity among community participants:

- Dynamic capacity allocation based on contribution or subscription levels
- Tokenized capacity rights that can be traded, leased, or transferred
- Energy contribution tracking (how much energy each user stores)
- Priority settings for critical needs (medical equipment, etc.)
- Overflow handling for excess energy storage needs
- Automated settlement of capacity disputes

### Usage Optimization Contract

Determines optimal charging and discharging patterns based on multiple factors:

- Grid pricing signals and time-of-use rate integration
- Weather forecasting data for renewable generation prediction
- Community energy consumption patterns
- Grid stability requirements and demand response opportunities
- Financial optimization algorithms to maximize value
- Carbon intensity tracking to minimize environmental impact

### Maintenance Fund Contract

Manages the collective resources for system upkeep and eventual replacement:

- Automated collection of maintenance fees based on usage
- Transparent fund management and reporting
- Smart contract-based approval for maintenance expenditures
- Depreciation tracking and replacement fund accumulation
- Emergency repair fund allocation
- Service provider reputation and payment tracking

## System Architecture

The system operates on a permissioned blockchain with varying access levels:

- **Community Members**: Access to personal energy storage allocation, usage data, and financial information
- **System Operators**: Monitoring of technical performance and maintenance needs
- **Grid Operators**: Integration with grid requirements and demand response programs
- **Administrators**: System governance and dispute resolution capabilities

All transactions are transparent, immutable, and accessible to appropriate stakeholders.

## Technical Implementation

- **Blockchain Platform**: Ethereum/Polygon for smart contract deployment
- **Oracle Integration**: ChainLink for real-time pricing, weather data, and grid status
- **IoT Connectivity**: Secure API connections to battery management systems
- **Frontend**: Web application and mobile interface for community members
- **Analytics**: AI-powered optimization algorithms for maximum efficiency
- **Security**: Multi-signature requirements for critical changes and expenditures

## Benefits

- **Enhanced Energy Autonomy**: Communities can maximize self-consumption of renewable energy
- **Economic Efficiency**: Reduced energy costs through optimal charging/discharging patterns
- **Transparency**: Clear tracking of usage, contributions, and costs
- **Resilience**: Improved community energy security during outages
- **Sustainability**: Maximized integration of renewable energy sources
- **Fairness**: Equitable distribution of benefits and costs among participants

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16+)
- Truffle Suite or Hardhat
- MetaMask or similar Web3 wallet
- Access to battery management system APIs

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-organization/community-energy-storage.git

# Install dependencies
cd community-energy-storage
npm install

# Configure environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your configuration details

# Deploy smart contracts
npx hardhat deploy --network [network-name]
```

### Running the Application

```bash
# Start the development server
npm run start
```

## Usage Examples

### For Community Members

1. Register as a participant and connect battery storage information
2. Set preferences for energy storage allocation and usage
3. Monitor real-time storage capacity and energy flows
4. Receive optimization recommendations and automated controls
5. View financial benefits and contribution to sustainability goals

### For System Administrators

1. Monitor overall system health and performance
2. Manage maintenance scheduling and contractor relationships
3. Generate performance reports and financial statements
4. Adjust optimization parameters based on community feedback
5. Coordinate with grid operators for demand response events

## Governance

The system incorporates DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) principles for community governance:

- Voting rights based on participation levels
- Proposal system for major system changes
- Transparent decision-making processes
- Graduated authority for different types of decisions
- Dispute resolution mechanisms

## Roadmap

- **Phase 1**: Core smart contract development and testing
- **Phase 2**: Integration with battery management systems
- **Phase 3**: Development of optimization algorithms
- **Phase 4**: Pilot deployment in select communities
- **Phase 5**: Integration with grid services and demand response programs
- **Phase 6**: Expansion to multi-community energy sharing networks
